This capstone project combined hardware engineering, embedded programming, and algorithmic logic to simulate intelligent vehicle movement.

 Technologies Used
Languages: C++, Arduino
Hardware: Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04), L298N Motor Driver, DC Motors
Design Tools: TinkerCAD, Fusion 360 (for 3D modeling), Breadboards, Custom PCB
Skills: Embedded systems, real-time sensor data handling, circuit design, CAD prototyping

Features
Autonomous forward movement with real-time obstacle detection
Reactive turning and braking logic using distance thresholds
Modular circuit board design for easy debugging and scalability
3D-printed chassis customized for component mounting and wire management

My Contributions
Coded the core logic for obstacle detection and avoidance in C++
Integrated sensor input and actuator response timing for accurate control
Designed and refined CAD models for chassis and component mounts
Presented final prototype at regional STEM competition; awarded Best in Competition
